## Unified Harness Memory (Shared DB)

For recording and searching across sessions, prefer the `harness_mem_*` MCP.

- Search: `harness_mem_search`, `harness_mem_timeline`, `harness_mem_get_observations`
- Injection: `harness_mem_resume_pack`
- Recording: `harness_mem_record_checkpoint`, `harness_mem_finalize_session`, `harness_mem_record_event`

## Relationship with Claude Code Auto-Memory (D22)

The Harness SSOT memory (Layer 2) coexists with Claude Code's automatic memory (Layer 1).
Auto-memory implicitly records general learnings, while SSOT explicitly manages project-specific decisions.
When insights from Layer 1 are important across the entire project, promote them to Layer 2 via `/memory ssot`.

## Execution Steps

1. Classify the user's request
2. Read the appropriate reference file from "Feature Reference" above
3. Execute according to its contents

## SSOT Promotion

Persists important learnings from memory systems (Claude-mem / Serena) into SSOT.

- "**Save what we learned**" → [references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md)
- "**Promote decisions to SSOT**" → [references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md)
